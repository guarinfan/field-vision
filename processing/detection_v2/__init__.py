"""
Phase Two detection prototype: RF-DETR object detection + pitch-area filtering
+ kit-colour team classification + temporal tracking with role stabilization.

This package is intentionally kept separate from `processing/worker.py`
(the live Modal pipeline). Nothing here is wired into the production
app/webhook flow. See processing/detection_v2/README.md for usage and for
the exact stub-vs-fine-tuned-model caveats.
